LEDs need to be switched in orientation as we are going from the right to left now
	Find the pins that we are going to be using

FSRs need to be hooked up and code to run added into UserWindow.py
	edit code to remove debuggin print statements
	Find pins for FSRs

Teach Pixy in order to detect certain items

Hot glue price strips

Fabric to cover wires and components

Possibly fasten everything to the shelf

Don't forget about the power brick for the rpi


LED Strip works with (PMW0) pins; 12,18
		--> Thinking of hooking both LEDs to one Pin
			Becomes (1-120) instead of (1-60)(1-60)

By the way, if (FSR>0)
			FSR = Annoying
		else
			FSR = Frustrating
