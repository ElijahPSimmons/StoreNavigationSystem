***Update 11/15/2018 1:30 am***
top Color Sensor now working but selected block turns
into entire screen instead of mustard or multimeter

Still having issues with import pixy on UserWindow.py
Comment out and everything else on customer side seems
to be working

Disregard UserWindow1.py 

Changed repository to my account (didn't want to take
risks with raspberry pi crashing) 
Username: trevorunruh5234
password: Twusixty523432

FSR detect ready to go (except just check 1 fsr rn)
file called ErrorDect2.py

Top LED's work but bottom not plugged in yet
LED code works (don't ask me how. I just think it hates you)
