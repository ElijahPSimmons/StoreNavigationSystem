# Store Navigation System

Senior Design Project ECE 591 Team Project

Create a device that will allow you to search the store for an item and give an option to light it up.  Then have an option to sense if the items are there and display a message for the employees to see that an item is missing or misplaced.

# What I Learned

* How to connect different sensors to the raspberry pi.
* Implement a GUI through python that is interactive and easy to use.
* Incorporate different sources of code for the different sensors to utilitze their capabilities.
